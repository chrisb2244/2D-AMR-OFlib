If you have problems in your second refinement step, giving messages like
"Direction from ownPt to neiPt was opposite to face normal", try switching the
toggle variable in <case>/constant/dynamicMeshDict first.

The variable should hold the value of 0 or 1. If the variable is not found in
the dynamicMeshDict *Coeffs{...} subdictionary, it will default to a value of
0.
